A company, active in Big Data and Data Science, offers training to Data Scientists. The company then wishes to hire trainees who pass courses in the training. Moreover, other than demographics, education, experience data, the company collects information on Data Scientists who wish to leave or retain their current roles.

With the data, the company can allocate enough resources to candidates who really want to work for them. This will reduce the cost and time the program will take. Also, the company can prioritize quality and better categorizing of candidates for better planning of the courses.
